I attached a file to my genspark AI drive that is called Amway Business Plan by DA\_1.1.3.1\_APKPure.apk and it's a .apk file. I want help creating this app either for mobile use (iphone) or desktop (mac) or web based (online). Can you help me recreate this app with all the functionality and features except I want to update the income an IBO can make to match the most updated Amway North America Business Plan. I've attached a few pdfs in my ai drive in this folder https://www.genspark.ai/aidrive/files/Amway that detail the Amway Business plan and the various ways that an IBO can get paid. Can you explain step by step how I can make this app? Can you create it for me? Even if it's in parts? Can you explain how I can create it step by step? I have no experience creating an app but I can follow directions really well and I'm tech savy so i can figure things out or leverage AI tools for support.

I'll help you recreate this Amway Business Plan app with updated income information. Let me start by examining your files to understand the current app structure and the updated business plan details.

Based on my analysis of your documents and research, I'll now provide you with a comprehensive plan to recreate the Amway Business Plan app with updated income calculations.

## **Complete Step-by-Step Guide to Recreating the Amway Business Plan App**

### **Understanding What We're Building**

Based on the documents you provided and typical Amway business plan calculators, your app likely includes these core features:

**Core Functionality:**

* **Income Calculator**: Calculate Performance Bonus, Leadership Bonus, Depth Bonus based on PV/BV  
* **Team Structure Visualizer**: Show downline organization and qualification levels  
* **Bonus Breakdown**: Display different income streams (retail, differential, leadership, etc.)  
* **Goal Setting Tools**: Set and track income/volume targets  
* **Updated Compensation Data**: Latest September 2024 North American business plan figures

### **Step 1: Choose Your Development Platform**

For someone with no coding experience, I recommend these three approaches:

#### **Option A: Web-Based App (Easiest \- Start Here)**

* ✅ Can be made to look like a native app

#### **Option B: Cross-Platform Mobile App**

**Platform: FlutterFlow or Adalo**

* ✅ Native mobile experience  
* ✅ Can publish to both iOS and Android  
* ❌ More complex initial setup

#### **Option C: Desktop Mac App**

**Platform: Bubble.io \+ Electron wrapper or Swift Playgrounds**

* ✅ Native Mac experience  
* ❌ Limited to Mac users only

### **Step 2: Plan Your App Structure**

Based on the Amway documents, here's the app structure:

📱 Amway Business Plan Calculator  
├── 🏠 Home Dashboard  
├── 💰 Income Calculator  
│   ├── Personal Sales Calculator  
│   ├── Performance Bonus Calculator  
│   ├── Leadership Bonus Calculator

│   └── Success Stories/Examples  
└── ⚙️ Settings  
    ├── Income Data Updates  
    └── Personal Information

### **Step 3: Gather Your Updated Data**

From your documents, here are the key figures to implement:

**Performance Bonus Schedule (2024):**

* 7,500+ PV: 25% of BV  
* 6,000-7,499 PV: 23% of BV  
* 4,000-5,999 PV: 21% of BV

Can we do this- Data Persistence: Save user data locally Team Tracking: Add multiple team members Progress Tracking: Monthly goal tracking Export Features: PDF reports, sharing options Offline Mode: Work without internet (Not as important, this can be a separate step after everything above is done this can be asked after to see if i still want it) I think the biggest thing missing is that it's missing the visual aspect of actually adding the downline groups visually and showing the entire business group. So not just frontline, but the frontline of my frontline all the way to the end of each leg. Does that make sense? Before doing anything let me know if you understand exactly what I am looking for. 

Yes, I understand exactly what you're looking for\!

Looking at the screenshots you provided, I can see the original app has a **visual tree/hierarchy structure**that shows:

* **Interactive Group Modeling**: You can visually build and modify your entire downline organization  
* **Multi-Level Visualization**: Shows not just your frontline (direct sponsors), but their frontlines, and their frontlines, etc. \- creating a complete visual tree of your entire organization  
* **Real-Time Calculations**: As you add/modify people in the visual tree, it automatically calculates rewards, bonuses, and income based on the complete group structure  
* **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Ability to add/remove IBOs visually with \+ and \- buttons  
* **Group Volume Tracking**: Each circle shows individual PV/BV and bonus percentages  
* **Hierarchical Reward Calculations**: Shows how leadership bonuses, depth bonuses, and differentials flow through the entire organization

The key missing element from my current web app is this **visual organizational chart builder** where you can:

* Click to add new IBOs at any level of your organization  
* See the complete tree structure (you → frontline → their frontline → etc.)  
* Drag and modify the structure  
* Have all calculations update in real-time based on the visual structure  
* Track multiple "legs" and their depth  
* Visualize how volume flows up through the organization

So essentially, you want a **visual business builder** that lets you model "what if" scenarios by building out your entire organization graphically, not just calculating based on totals you input manually.

Before I create the enhanced version with these visual modeling capabilities, let me confirm:

* **Visual Tree Builder**: Interactive organizational chart where you can add IBOs at any level  
* **Data Persistence**: Save multiple business scenarios/models locally  
* **Team Member Profiles**: Each IBO in the tree can have their own PV/BV/details  
* **Progress Tracking**: Track monthly performance across the entire organization  
* **Export Features**: PDF reports of the visual tree and calculations  
* **Real-time Calculations**: All bonuses update as you modify the visual structure

Is this correct? Should I proceed with building this enhanced visual version?

Copy

Deep Research

yes this is correct thank you\! you can proceed

Perfect\! I'll create an enhanced version with the visual organizational chart builder and all the features you requested. This will be a comprehensive upgrade that includes the interactive tree structure, data persistence, team tracking, and export capabilities.

Deep Research  
This is such a great improvement from the first draft. One issue that I see is that the Performance Analytics graph once you enter any business data in the organization structure the graph starts to expand continuously and stretches down the y axis. Can you fix that? Also can you have the BV of all IBOs adjust accordingly based on the average PV to BV ratio which should be included in the pdfs in the Amway folder in my AI drive? So what I mean is if someone does 150pv that should equate to a certain amount of BV based on the ratio.

Also can you add a feature where you can also include and toggle different months within the fiscal year. The months that should be included should be all of the months in the current fiscal year and then there should be options to also include months for the next fiscal year. 

Also if business data is input for multiple months please show the annual or how every many months have data should show how much income is earned over that period. There should be an option to apply the current business structure that someone puts in one month to multiple months maybe with a checkbox and then the income over that time period should be shown based on the business structure and volume.   Also there should be ways where incentives and bonuses outside the general plan can be checked off or included in income summary for any month(s).   Also there should be an option to delete downline IBOS individually or a specific individual and their entire group. Also let’s say I’m trying to calculate how much income I’d make in a 2 month period and I have several frontline ibos who also have downline. Let’s say someone in between quits or leaves, I dont want the entire group to be deleted, it should just move the downline up just like what would happen if someone in between 2 ibos in a group quit. Does that make sense?

Absolutely\! These are excellent improvements that will make the app much more realistic and functional. Let me break down what you're asking for to make sure I understand correctly:

## **Issues to Fix & Features to Add:**

### **1\. Performance Analytics Graph Bug**

* ✅ Fix the Y-axis stretching issue when business data is entered

### **2\. Automatic BV Calculation**

* ✅ Extract PV to BV ratio from your Amway PDFs  
* ✅ Auto-calculate BV based on entered PV using the official ratio  
* ✅ Make this automatic so users just enter PV and BV calculates

### **3\. Multi-Month Fiscal Year Planning**

* ✅ Add month selector for current fiscal year (all 12 months)  
* ✅ Add next fiscal year months as options  
* ✅ Toggle between different months to enter different business scenarios

### **4\. Multi-Month Income Calculations**

* ✅ Include these in income summaries for any selected month(s)

### **6\. Advanced Team Management**

* ✅ Delete individual IBOs without affecting their downline  
* ✅ Delete an IBO and their entire group  
* ✅ **Smart restructuring**: When someone "quits" mid-level, move their downline up automatically (like real-life scenarios)

### **7\. Realistic Business Scenarios**

* ✅ Handle situations where someone in the middle of a leg quits  
* ✅ Automatically restructure the organization tree  
* ✅ Maintain proper calculations after restructuring

In the image i attached to this message called Screenshot 2025-08-10 at 3.03.56 AM. The visual builder is now not functioning, when I click the circle that says "you" nothing changes or happens. I am not able to enter any details. Also when I add a downline, nothing shows, the downline bubble does not appear but the income below updates as you see in the image. Can you fix that? Also can you make the name of the IBO field option optional? Also can you show the lines that connect downline to their upline? I included a picture of the previous version you created because it showed the downline which is what I want but it's still missing the lines that show the downline connected to their upline. this is in image Screenshot 2025-08-10 at 3.08.30 AM. Also can you add an option where you can click if "You" as well as any of the downline have met the VCS baseline requirements. If not, that should affect the IBOs income and how much BV goes upline. This should be explained in one of the pdfs in the Amway folder in my Ai drive. Also on the visual builder tab, can you include an option to select what month in the fiscal year that business structure is for and then that would could be auto applied to the multi month planning For the incentives tab can you actually have the incentives auto calculated including the amount that would be earned based on the business structure that is in the visual builder tab and the multi month planning tab? You can also include a manual override to type in figures. So what i mean is let's say in the visual builder tab and or the multi month planning tab the business structure is 7500 pv for 6 months straight or 12 months straight and the group met all Amway IBO requirements for VCS and everything was in good standing, then that business would automatically qualify for a platinum incentive and/or founders platinum incentive. Does this make sense? Also something else I want you to include not now because I want you to focus on everything I asked above, but the next thing we will add are any other ways an Amway IBO can get paid based on the information in the pdfs in the Amway folder in my AI drive.

I understand all the issues and can see exactly what's wrong from your screenshots. Let me break down what I need to fix and add:

## **Issues to Fix:**

* **✅ Visual Builder Not Working**: "You" circle not clickable, member details not showing  
* **✅ Downline Not Visible**: Income updates but circles don't appear  
* **✅ Missing Connection Lines**: Need lines showing upline-downline relationships  
* **✅ Name Field**: Make IBO name optional

## **Features to Add:**

* **✅ VCS Baseline Requirements**: Check if IBOs meet VCS requirements (affects income/BV flow)  
* **✅ Month Selection on Visual Builder**: Select fiscal year month on Visual Builder tab  
* **✅ Auto-Calculated Incentives**: Automatically calculate Platinum/Founders Platinum incentives based on structure  
* **✅ Manual Override**: Option to manually adjust incentive amounts

Let me first check the VCS requirements from your documents:

The lines connecting downline to upline are still missing, also the formatting of how the group looks is off, it's not centered how it was previously. Also each IBO should be a circle as well and the information in the circle should be easily visible, its difficult to see all of the information. Also I can see the months option is there a way on the visual builder tab to push that information to the Multi-month planning tab automatically based on the month selected so that that income info is populated and included in the overall income calculations. Also for any place where an IBOs monthly, multiple months, or yearly income is shown, there should be an expand/collapse option that actually shows in detail itemized way how the income is calculated. Also I want you to auto calculate all incentives if the business structure shows that the IBO qualifies for it. Not just platinum and founders platinum but any incentive or bonus that an ibo can qualify for. Also for the visual builder, every group that is pushed to the multi month planning page to be included in a multi month income calculation, a screenshot or copy of the business group should be copied in sequential date order for each month that is pushed to that page. Also please fix the expand and collapse function on the visual builder tab. I included a screenshot of the issue Im facing to this message. Also with the visual builder can you make that space so you can zoom in/zoom out as the business group gets bigger or smaller so you can see relevant information and strucutre. Also you can make it so that it automatically adjusts how zoomed in or out it is and then also include a button or option to click to zoom in or out. Also if possible, include an option on the visual builder page where you can click a downline IBO and toggle and switch to seeing the business as if they are the upline so it should show how much income that IBO would make based on their personal volume and group. Does that make sense? So that the app not only shows the data and information from "You" or the upline but you can switch to see how downline are performing and how much income they're making and incentives theyre earning based on their structure? Does that make sense? So let's say "You" has a frontline who has a business structure and group that is 7500pv for 6 months, that would make them a platinum, so they would qualify for bonuses and incentives so if that frontline IBO is clicked or maybe theirs a button or option to switch to that IBO but when that is clicked or toggled, everything switches to the perspective of that IBO that qualified platinum does that make sense?

I understand all the issues and new features you want\! Let me break them down:

## **Issues to Fix:**

This visual builder still is not showing any downline which also means there are no lines visible connecting downline to upline. Also the muti month tab shows a simple business structure timeline, please keep that at the top, then at the bottom below the income projections include the actual visual of the entire business group and business strucutre with downline. Also the income projections should say yearly income if the amount is referring to how much would be earned for a year. If it's a specific number of months just include the number of months like Total Projected income for \[Starting month that was selected \- ending month that was selected\] Also on the visual builder tab there should be a button that is clicked that will copy the relevant information, data, values, replica of the visual business structure to the multi-month planning tab for whatever month(s) were clicked and selected. Also at the bottom include the Amway disclaimer which may be this but it's also in the pdfs in the amway folder of my AI drive \[ Important Disclaimers Income Disclosure: For the calendar year 2023, the average income from Amway for all U.S. registered IBOs at the Founders Platinum level and below was $841 before expenses. Results Vary: Earnings depend on many factors, including customer base, business experience, effort, dedication, and quality and performance of the downline sales team. Baseline Requirements: To receive incentives and awards, IBOs must meet baseline requirements including average 150 Personal PV monthly, at least 60% from Verified Customer Sales, and adherence to Rules of Conduct. This calculator provides estimates based on 2024 compensation plan data and should be used for planning purposes only.\]

I see the issues clearly\! The Visual Builder is still not showing downlines properly, and the Multi-Month Planning needs the actual visual business structures displayed below the timeline. Let me fix all these issues and add the proper Amway disclaimer from your documents.

First, let me get the exact Amway disclaimer from your documents:

Can you fix the layout and spacing and organization of the organization structure on the visual builder tab. I attached a screenshot to show you what's happening. The organization structure should be a tree diagram where none of the circles that represent different IBOs should overlap each other or get in the way of each other. Also on the multi month planning page, the visual business structures by month do not look like the organization structure on the visual builder tab. The visual business structures by month should be exactly like it is on the visual builder page for the specific month. Also for the monthly income and performance bonus combine that into monthly income and if that's clicked then it should show an even more complete detailed itemized line list of how the income is calculated. It should show the differentials for each group too and how that's calculated. All of this can be found in the Amway PDFs. Also when you click the analytics tab it doesnt show that it was clicked and that tab is not highlighted, the wrong tab is highlighted. Also the months that are shown in the graph should reflect and auto adjust to the data and time period where information was input. Also include an option to scroll to the past/future left and right on the x axis to see data from the start of the fiscal year all the way up to the end of the next fiscal year on the right. However the view of how many months can be seen at any time should be 6-12 months at a time. Does that make sense?

I understand all the issues perfectly\! Let me fix each one:

## **Issues to Fix:**

### **1\. Visual Builder Layout Problems:**

* ✅ **Overlapping Circles**: IBOs are overlapping and crowded  
* ✅ **Tree Diagram**: Need proper hierarchical tree structure  
* ✅ **Clean Spacing**: No circles should overlap or interfere with each other  
* ✅ **Connection Lines**: Proper lines showing hierarchy

### **2\. Multi-Month Visual Business Structures:**

* ✅ **Exact Replica**: Should look exactly like Visual Builder tab  
* ✅ **Proper Tree Layout**: Same hierarchical structure as Visual Builder  
* ✅ **Month-Specific**: Show the actual structure for each month

### **3\. Income Display Issues:**

* ✅ **Combine Monthly Income \+ Performance Bonus**: Into one "Monthly Income" section  
* ✅ **Detailed Breakdown**: Click to show complete itemized calculations  
* ✅ **Differential Calculations**: Show differentials for each group with formulas  
* ✅ **Complete Formula Display**: All calculations from Amway PDFs

### **4\. Analytics Tab Issues:**

* ✅ **Tab Highlighting**: Analytics tab not properly highlighted when selected  
* ✅ **Auto-Adjust Months**: Graphs should reflect actual data input periods  
* ✅ **Scrollable Timeline**: Left/right scroll from start of fiscal year to end of next fiscal year  
* ✅ **6-12 Month View**: Show 6-12 months at a time with scroll controls

Let me get the detailed differential calculation formulas from your Amway documents:

Now the page starts off like this instead of just "You" as the single IBO. Also you're unable to add any downline and visually see any of them on the page. Can you fix that. I want it so that when the page is first opened, it just shows "You" with 150pv. Then anything can be adjusted for "You" and downline can be added as well as all of the other detailed functionalities we've planned through together. 

I see the issue\! The page is starting with a pre-populated organization structure instead of just "You", and the add downline functionality isn't working properly. Let me fix this so it starts clean with just "You" and all the functionality works correctly.
